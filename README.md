# Simple training APIs - Restaurants API

This is a super simple implementation of the basic requirements for this API.

We have not implemented much error-handling to keep the "happy path" code simple.

This also helps to make the code easily readable for beginners to API development, API testing / test automation.

Happy Automation!
